## What is LoopBack Mac?

LoopBack Mac is designed for creators who need flexible **[audio routing](#)** on macOS without external mixers or cable workarounds. It lets you create **[virtual audio devices](#)** that can receive audio from multiple apps and deliver a clean, controlled signal to recording, streaming, or communication tools.

This approach is ideal for podcasting and live production. Combine microphone input with system audio, route app audio into a capture tool, or send a custom mix to conferencing software. With predictable routing, you can build repeatable setups that work the same way every time.

LoopBack Mac supports more advanced **[recording workflows](#)** by allowing mixing, splitting outputs, and level control so you can monitor, isolate, or blend sources in real time. That makes complex sessions easier to manage even when multiple apps are involved.

With a clean interface and reliable performance, LoopBack Mac turns complicated macOS audio setups into something structured and controllable—so creators can focus on content instead of troubleshooting.
